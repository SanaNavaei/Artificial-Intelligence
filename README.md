## CA0

In this project, we will be using several Python libraries that are important tools in the Jupyter Notebook environment. The main libraries used in this project are matplotlib, numpy, and pandas.  
We will first analyze by using the Titanic passengers dataset to predict the survival of passengers, then we apply various techniques to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster.

## CA1

In this project, we will be solving a problem using various searching methods such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), and Weighted A\*.  
The problem at hand involves searching a graph to find recipes and delivering them in the minimum amount of time. We will explore different algorithms and techniques to efficiently navigate the graph and optimize the delivery process. This project will involve graph traversal, heuristic evaluation, and algorithmic optimization to solve the problem effectively.
