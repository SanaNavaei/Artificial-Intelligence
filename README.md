## CA0

In this project, we will be using several Python libraries that are important tools in the Jupyter Notebook environment. The main libraries used in this project are matplotlib, numpy, and pandas.  
We will first analyze by using the Titanic passengers dataset to predict the survival of passengers, then we apply various techniques to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster.

## CA1

In this project, we will be solving a problem using various searching methods such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), and Weighted A\*.  
The problem at hand involves searching a graph to find recipes and delivering them in the minimum amount of time. We will explore different algorithms and techniques to efficiently navigate the graph and optimize the delivery process. This project will involve graph traversal, heuristic evaluation, and algorithmic optimization to solve the problem effectively.

## CA2

In this project, we will be simulating a game called Sim Pencil, which involves two agents playing against each other. One of the agents will be using the alpha-beta minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, while the other agent will be playing randomly. By comparing the performance of these two agents, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the alpha-beta minimax algorithm in playing the Sim Pencil game.

## CA3

In this project, we will be solving a mathematical equality problem using a genetic algorithm. The problem involves finding the combination of operands and operators that satisfy a given equation of length n and its corresponding answer. The genetic algorithm will mimic the process of natural selection and evolution to iteratively generate and refine potential solutions. By using genetic methods such as mutation, crossover, and selection, we aim to find the optimal combination of operands and operators that satisfy the equation.
